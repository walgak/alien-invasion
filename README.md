# alien-invasion
 A 2D shooting game made with python

 The player controls a space ship that appears in the center of the screen.
 The player can move the ship right or left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar.
 When the game begins, a fleet of alien ships will be on screen moving across and town towards the bottom. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player survives the fleet, a new fleet appears and the dificulty lever increases. If any alien ship makes contact with the player's ship the player loses and the game ends.
